<title>IT Interest and Background</title>
</head>
<body>
<div><h2>When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest?</h2>
<p>My interest in IT was sparked as a really young child, by my dad, who bought a Sinclair ZX81 back from Cambridge UK. He couldn’t work it. I taught myself to program in Basic and could get a few tricks out of the simple machine. That was exciting for a child in primary school.</p>
<h2>What is your interest in IT? Outline your IT experience (if any)</h2>
<p>My interest in IT has been mainly career focused and centred around large corporate programs of work. I have worked in IT for over 20 years. I started on helpdesk, then Local Area Network Administration, then programming in the late 1990s and business analysis in the 2000s.
<p>Note I am not adept at PC building and I am a hopeless gamer. This is my first foray into html5 and CSS coding.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I am interested in the user experience and enjoyed User Centred Design here at RMIT. However, I am also keenly interested in two IT business areas: software defect/quality management; and security. I just finished a contract as Defect Manager on an EAMS Transformation Program for Urban Utilities (Brisbane Water). What I like about defect management is building a cross functional bug hunting team out of a number of disparate and usually hitherto silo-orientated development teams. There is a revelation that happens when teams from different development teams realise they will not have a working solution unless their segments of code interface effectively with another team’s segments of code. I have found that using deliberate team building techniques and a cadence of short sharp and fun daily meetings accelerates this team building.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Security is a relatively new interest for me, growing over the last two to three years. I am yet to have the opportunity to work in a focused Security role, but started searching information regarding hacking and attacks, particularly large scale and politically motivated attacks like Stuxnet and the Sony attack a couple of years ago. A great introductory source for me was the Great Courses series on Cybersecurity with Paul Rosenzweig: titled “Thinking about Cybersecurity: From Cyber Crime to Cyber Warfare”. You can access that <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Thinking-about-Cybersecurity-From-Cyber-Crime-to-Cyber-Warfare-Audiobook/B00FQC7JBU?source_code=M2MOR131091619005N&ds_rl=1252391&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIpIqo6PKK6gIVjX4rCh1KTwg1EAAYAiAAEgK_BPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds">here at Audible</a>.</p>
<p>I think the need for cyber security specialists will explode in the next few years. As I write this today, the Prime Minister is speaking about a sophisticated state actor currently attacking many state and commercial organisations in Australia.</p>
<p>I am also studying Security in Computing and IT at RMIT this study period concurrently with this subject, so that is quite exciting.</p>
