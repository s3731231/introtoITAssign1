<h2>Reflection on and How I will Apply My Results</h2>
<p></p>
<h3>What do the results of these tests mean for you?</h3>
<p>The Myers Briggs test results were not a surprise as I have tested as ENTJ in recent years. When I was a very young adult (20+ years ago) I tested as ENFP so it is interesting to see my personality shift a bit as I mature. I am slower to volunteer information to an audience without considering the consequences these days and have a much smaller circle of friends. However, I am also responsible for bigger budgets and teams and more to consider so I think that’s probably a natural shift. I have heard others say their type has shifted over the years. Regarding the learning style test, again not too surprising. I knew I was a visual learner too and I use this when I study, though I may try to use more colour and pictures in my study journey. The creativity test was a disappointment. I thought I was a creative problem solver, but it seems less creative than average. I may need to shake things up a bit and get some creative thinking happening.</p>
<h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
<p>I tend towards taking charge of a team, however I am careful not to overstep my mandate (as perhaps my younger ENFP self would not have been). I have learned to sit and observe the dynamic then formulate an approach to get an effective team together, from within the role I have been assigned. Regarding being a visual learner, I realise that I must look directly at the speaker. I literally do not hear and understand them as well if I don’t look directly at them.</p>
<p>I am clearly not the most creative thinker in the team so need to ensure I have those creative contributors onboard and listen to their ideas and champion them.</p>
<h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>I need to ensure I have a mix of personality types within a team. I need to be sure to take into account the approach and preferences of those who feel a little more (F) than think (T) and those who are more Introvert (I) than Extrovert (E). It is important to give space and time to those who are more reticent, so that their opinions are tabled and considered. I need to give space and ask open questions to elucidate their contribution and thoughts. I also need to ensure I have the endorsement of the team before taking charge; it’s not always best to be the leader. Rather the team needs the best leader.</p>
