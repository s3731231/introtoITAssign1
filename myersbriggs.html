<h2>Myers Briggs Test Results</h2>
<p></p>
<p>I completed the test at Human Metrics<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>These were my results:</p>
<h3>ENTJ</h3>
<h3>Extravert(19%)  iNtuitive(12%)  Thinking(12%)  Judging(3%)</h3>
<h4>You have slight preference of Extraversion over Introversion (19%)</h4>
<h4>You have slight preference of Intuition over Sensing (12%)</h4>
<h4>You have slight preference of Thinking over Feeling (12%)</h4>

<h3>Extraverted iNtuitive Thinking Judging</h3>
<blockquote>"I don't care to sit by the window on an airplane. If I can't control it, why look?"</blockquote>

<p>ENTJs have a natural tendency to marshall and direct. This may be expressed with the charm and finesse of a world leader or with the insensitivity of a cult leader. The ENTJ requires little encouragement to make a plan. One ENTJ put it this way... "I make these little plans that really don't have any importance to anyone else, and then feel compelled to carry them out." While "compelled" may not describe ENTJs as a group, nevertheless the bent to plan creatively and to make those plans reality is a common theme for NJ types.</p>
<p></p>
<p>ENTJs are often "larger than life" in describing their projects or proposals. This ability may be expressed as salesmanship, story-telling facility or stand-up comedy. In combination with the natural propensity for filibuster, our hero can make it very difficult for the customer to decline.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Personality Types: ENTJ</h3>
<p>TRADEMARK: -- "I'm really sorry you have to die." (I realize this is an overstatement. However, most Fs and other gentle souls usually chuckle knowingly at this description.)</p>

<p>ENTJs are decisive. They see what needs to be done, and frequently assign roles to their fellows. Few other types can equal their ability to remain resolute in conflict, sending the valiant (and often leading the charge) into the mouth of hell. When challenged, the ENTJ may by reflex become argumentative. Alternatively (s)he may unleash an icy gaze that serves notice: the ENTJ is not one to be trifled with.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>ENTJ Career Choices</h3>
<p></p>
<p>ENTJs often find themselves in occupations that require good analytical and planning skills. ENTJs build successful careers in those areas that require considerable organizational skills and intellectual effort, in occupations that present a challenge and call for creativity. They are greatly represented in technological and management consulting companies among engineers and developers, and among high- and mid-rank managers. They are also able to realize their potential in start-ups where they often fulfill management positions or take responsibility for the whole project.</p>
<p>Note IT and Software Engineering management fell within the list!</p>
