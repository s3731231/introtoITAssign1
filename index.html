<h3>Introduction - The Basics about Kylie</h3>
<p>I am an Australian mainly of Anglo-Celtic ethnic background and apart from some schoolgirl French and Indonesian I can only speak English. I live in Queensland on the Sunshine Coast having moved here from New South Wales 15 years ago.  I am currently undertaking my 8th, 9th and 10th subjects towards a Bachelor of Information Technology from RMIT. This will be my first completed undergraduate degree. I elected to tackle 3 subjects this study period as I have deliberately taken a break from paid work. The timing was right as I was on a Program of work that just ended.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Something a little different about me is that I have an active left and right brain, so I approach problems from both a creative and analytical perspective. I also like to explore different projects. For example, 8 years ago, I started the Sunshine Coast’s first food magazine. It was short lived (and very costly) but beautiful and a great experience.  I am interested in food growing, farming and gardening. It’s a good counterpoint for the hours in front of the computer. I particularly love orchids.</p>
