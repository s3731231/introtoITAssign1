<title>RMIT Aspirations</title>

<h2>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h2>
<p>I chose RMIT to study with because I wanted a comprehensive technical degree and my research told me RMIT was one of the best universities for this. Our local university (Sunshine Coast) does not have the meaty IT content within its degrees and its reputation in IT suffers accordingly.</p>
<h2>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h2>
<p>My aim is to build and finesse my technical skills so that I can more effectively manage teams and be able to sniff out the best path to problem resolution in my work, through having a good understanding of IT. Ideally I would like to move into Cybersecurity, possibly in a government based role, working to thwart state based malicious actors, or in a governance role in Security for a major utility.</p>
